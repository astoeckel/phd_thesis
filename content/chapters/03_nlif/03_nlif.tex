\chapter{Computational Properties of Multi-Compartment LIF Neurons}

\vspace{30pt}

\begin{OpeningQuote}
It may well be that certain nerve pulse combinations will stimulate a given neuron not simply by virtue of their number but also by virtue of the spatial relations of the synapses to which they arrive. This is, one may have to face situations in which there are, say, hundreds of synapses on a single nerve cell, and the combinations of stimulations on these that are effective [...] are characterised not only by their number, but also by their coverage of certain special regions on that neuron [...], by the spatial relations of such regions to each other, and by even more complicated quantiative and geometrical relationships that might be relevant.

\begin{PriorPublication}
Portions of this chapter (in particular \Cref{sec:two_comp_lif}) are, in extended and heavily edited form, adapted from \citet{stoeckel2021}, which in turn is an extension of work presented at COSYNE 2018 \citep{stockel2018nonlinear}, as well as an earlier technical report \citep{stockel2017point}.
%Chris Eliasmith supervised this work and edited the manuscripts.
%Aaron Voelker contributed with valuable ideas regarding experimental paradigms during the initial research phase.
Whereas these prior publications focus on single- and two-compartment LIF neurons, we deepen the provided theoretical background and define and discuss $n$-LIF neurons in general.

\begin{Contributions}
The work in this chapter can be seen as a continuation of the research presented in \citet[Chapter~5]{koch1999biophysics}, as well as \citet[Chapter~4]{tripp2009search}.
In contrast to these prior publication, we discuss a systematic approach to using passive dendritic nonlinearities as a computational resource to approximate arbitrary functions within the context of functional modelling frameworks.
We particularly focus on convex optimisation, ensuring globally optimal solutions.
Additionally, as far as we are aware, the idea to use quadratic programming for subthreshold relaxation is novel.
