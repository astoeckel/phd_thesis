\chapter{Modelling Neurobiological Systems}
\label{chp:modelling_neurobiological_systems}

\begin{OpeningQuote}
First, it is an overstatement to describe what I am attempting here as an \enquote{approach toward the understanding}; it is merely a somewhat systematized set of speculations as to how such an approach ought to be made. That is, I am trying to guess which of the---mathematically guided---lines of attack seem, from the hazy distance in which we see most of them, a priori promising, and which ones have the opposite appearance.

Parts of this chapter, particularly \Cref{sec:nef}, are based on \citet{stoeckel2021}.
Some figures in this chapter were adapted from material previously prepared for the University of Waterloo course SYDE 556/720, \enquote{Simulating Neurobiological Systems} taught by the author in winter 2020.
