\subsection{Comparison between the LDN and Modified Fourier Systems}
\label{sec:ldn_mfn_basis_bandlimit}

\Citet[Section~6.1.1]{voelker2019} notes that the LDN system optimally approximates a time-delay for low-frequency inputs generated by an LTI system of order $p + q = 2q - 1$.
However, for our experiments in \Cref{sec:comparing_temporal_bases}, we used low-pass filtered white noise, which technically consists of infinitely many (albeit severely dampened) frequency components.
We found that LTI systems generating a modified Fourier basis can outperform the LDN in this scenario.

As is depicted in \Cref{fig:delay_analysis_example_bandlimited,fig:delay_analysis_bandlimited}, we test whether switching to a strictly band-limited inputs $u(t)$ impacts the performance of these two systems.
Indeed, using strictly band-limited signals substantially reduces the errors for both the modified Fourier system and the LDN.
However, the modified Fourier system still significantly outperforms the LDN.

The analysis is as in \Cref{fig:delay_analysis_overview,fig:delay_analysis_boxplots}, but for a strictly band-limited white noise signal with a maximum frequency of \SI{10}{\hertz} over $T = \SI{10}{\second}$.
	Note that adding more basis functions beyond $q = 20$ barely improves the accuracy of the Fourier-based system.
	Two stars indicate $p < 0.01$, three stars $p < 0.001$.}
