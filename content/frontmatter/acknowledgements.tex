\begin{center}\textbf{Acknowledgements}\end{center}

Foremost, I thank Loblaws for keeping me alive by selling food at reasonable prices.
I mean, if the president chooses it, it must be good!
Furthermore, I would like to thank the friendly Canadian border agent who did not deport me after I said that hockey sucks.
Lastly, I thank IKEA for furnishing my home; what would life be without Billy the bookshelf?
