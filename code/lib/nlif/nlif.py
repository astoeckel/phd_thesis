        The SimulationResult class holds the result of a single-neuron

        properties are only available if the corresponding `record_*` flag was
        specified in the call to the `simulator` function.

        Properties
        ----------

        state: neuron state after the simulation finished. This can be passed as
        "state" parameter to a subsequent call to the simulator.

        out: computed spike train expressed as an additive superposition of
        discretised delta functions. In other words, spikes are represented as
        entries with magnitude $1 / dt$ in the array, all other entries are
        zero.

        isom: recorded somatic current. The somatic current is that current,
        that if injected into a standard current-based LIF neuron, would create
        exactly the same output as the simulated neuron.

        v: recorded voltage trace. Rows in the matrix correspond to individual
        samples, columns to the individual neuron compartments.

        times: exact spike times computed down to a resolution of
        `spike_time_resolution` specified in the call to `simulator`. The
        length of this array corresponds to the number of spikes in the
        simulation period.

        refractory period during this particular time-step.

        Returns a class with methods "simulate" and "simulate_poisson" that can

        sum of delta functions, as well as the final neuron state.

        Parameters
        ----------

        dt: timestep in seconds. Per default, a one millisecond timestep is
        used. This should be sufficient in most cases, since the system is
        solved using an implicit Euler method and spike times are computed
        exactly.

        record_isom: If true, additionally records the current flowing into the
        soma at any point in time. Note that this does not include the

        record_voltages: If true, additionally records the voltage in each
        compartment.

        record_spike_times: If true, records the precise spike times in
        addition to returning the discretised sum of delta functions (with a
        resolution restricted to dt). Result will be a list of spike times for
        each output spikes. This feature allows precise spike frequence
        measurements if the neuron is firing regularly.

        record_in_refrac: If true, records the refractory state of the neuron.
        This is an array of boolean flags, indicating whether the neuron was in
        the refractory period at the corresponding timestep. This data is useful
        to mask out currents flowing while the neuron is in the refractory
        period.
