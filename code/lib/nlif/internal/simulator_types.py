class Result:
    """
    The `Result` class holds the result of a single-neuron
    simulation, e.g., the state of the neuron and the recorded quantities.
    Note that only `state` and `out` are available per default. The other
    properties are only available if the corresponding `record_*` flag was
    specified in the call to the `simulator` function.

    Properties
    ----------

    state: neuron state after the simulation finished. This can be passed as
    "state" parameter to a subsequent call to the simulator.

    out: computed spike train expressed as an additive superposition of
    discretised delta functions. In other words, spikes are represented as
    entries with magnitude $1 / dt$ in the array, all other entries are
    zero.

    isom: recorded somatic current. The somatic current is that current,
    that if injected into a standard current-based LIF neuron, would create
    exactly the same output as the simulated neuron.

    v: recorded voltage trace. Rows in the matrix correspond to individual
    samples, columns to the individual neuron compartments.

    times: exact spike times computed down to a resolution of
    `spike_time_resolution` specified in the call to `simulator`. The
    length of this array corresponds to the number of spikes in the
    simulation period.

    in_refrac: boolean array indicating whether the neuron has been in its
    refractory period during this particular time-step.
