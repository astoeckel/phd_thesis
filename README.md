## Abstract

Researchers study nervous systems at levels of scale spanning several orders of magnitude, both in terms of time and space.
While some parts of the brain are well understood at specific levels of description, there are few overarching theories that systematically bridge low-level mechanism and high-level function.
The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) is an attempt at providing such a theory.
The NEF enables researchers to systematically map dynamical systems‚Äícorresponding to some hypothesised brain function‚Äíonto biologically constrained spiking neural networks.
In this thesis, we present several extensions to the NEF that broaden both the range of neural resources that can be harnessed for spatiotemporal computation and the range of available biological constraints.
Specifically, we suggest a method for harnessing the dynamics inherent in passive dendritic trees for computation, allowing us to construct single-layer spiking neural networks that, for some functions, achieve substantially lower errors than larger multi-layer networks.
Furthermore, we suggest ‚Äútemporal tuning‚Äù as a unifying approach to harnessing temporal resources for computation through time.
This allows modellers to directly constrain networks to temporal tuning observed in nature, in ways not previously well-supported by the NEF.

We then explore specific examples of neurally plausible dynamics using these techniques.
In particular, we propose a new ‚Äúinformation erasure‚Äù technique for constructing LTI systems generating temporal bases.
Such LTI systems can be used to establish an optimal basis for spatiotemporal computation.
We demonstrate how this captures ‚Äútime cells‚Äù that have been observed throughout the brain.
As well, we demonstrate the viability of our extensions by constructing an adaptive filter model of the cerebellum that successfully reproduces key features of eyeblink conditioning observed in neurobiological experiments.

Outside the cognitive sciences, our work can help exploit resources available on existing neuromorphic computers, and inform future neuromorphic hardware design.
In machine learning, our spatiotemporal NEF populations map cleanly onto the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU), a promising artificial neural network architecture for stream-to-stream processing that outperforms competing approaches.
We find that one of our LTI systems derived through ‚Äúinformation erasure‚Äù may serve as a computationally less expensive alternative to the LTI system commonly used in the LMU.


## Reproducing the Thesis

### üíª Virtual Machine (VM) Image

To build the PDF and to execute the experiments, download the Fedora 33 VM image from OSF:

https://osf.io/qdxyf/

This image is in the `qcow2` format and compatible with a standard x86_64 KVM/QEMU VM (for example, use `virt-manager` or *Gnome Boxes* do create a new VM).

The username and password are:
```
thesis_user
HTVwkwbxdBdcc4B
```

Note that the VM has `sshd` enabled, so you can log in via SSH and use `sshfs` or `sftp` to transfer files.

Within the VM, execute the `download_thesis_and_data.sh`.
This will download the experiment data from OSF, this repository from GitHub, and attempts to build the thesis PDF.
This will re-generate all figures and requires some time (about 15-60 minutes depending on your machine) and a copious amount of RAM.

### üí° Running the Experiments

If you wish to do so, you can also re-run all experiments within the VM.

All longer-runing experiments are executed within a Docker container and linked to a specific revision of this repository.
The experiments and generated files are listed under `code/Manifest.toml`.

Executing the experiments requires Linux with Python and a working Docker installation (provided in the VM), as well as a computer with at least 16 CPU cores (32 with hyperthreading) and 128 GB of RAM.

If you have downloaded the experiment data from OSF in the previous step, make sure to delete the `data/generated` folder.

Then, simply run
```
./scripts/run_experiments.py
```
to re-run all experiments. This will take several weeks.

Use the `--help` argument to obtain list of available commands; use `--list` to list all experiments and their build status.
