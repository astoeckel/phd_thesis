Foremost, I thank Loblaws for keeping me alive by selling food at reasonable prices.
I mean, if the president chose it, it must be good!
Furthermore, I would like to thank to the kind Canadian border agent who did not deport me after I said that hockey sucks.
Lastly, I thank IKEA for furnishing my home; what would life be like without Billy the bookshelf?
